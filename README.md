# Work Day Scheduler

## Desciption

### This project involved me creating a simple schedule for a typical work day from 9am - 5pm. The aim of the project was to be able to add data to the time block and save it as well as retrieve it from localstorage and have everything displayed in real time using moment.js. The timeblock and function of the app was constructed dynamically using javascript. 


# Usage

## You can access the page via this link: https://hoggi90.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

### The time blocks that have already passed the time, will be colorued in grey, the current time block hour will be in red and the future time block times will be in green. You can add data to the middle desciption section and click on the save button on the right side to save the data to localstorage.

### Right-click on the browser and choose inspect, then click on elements to view the JS script, HTML and CSS files.
